## General info
The Text'em chat app's tagline is "chat with friends and strangers alike." It has a number of features, the most essential of which is the ability to participate in real-time chats with other signed in users. The connection is smooth and the navigation is simple thanks to the usage of websockets. Make sure to give it a go and interact with others! It is a big step in a direction of implementing more backend technologies such as websocket connections, SQL databases and managing a server.
